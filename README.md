# Stomping Ground
## A React app that brings together property listings data, neighborhood walkability score, and Google Maps user photos.

To be deployed publicly in March 2021

**Browse property listings and get a look inside neighborhoods you're interested in by examining walkability scores and real user-uploaded photos.**

In a time when global and even local travel has been shut down, people still want to get a sense of the neighbourhood they're considering moving to. Walkability to nearby amenities and access to transit is an important factor in choosing a home.

What differentiates Stomping Ground from existing websites is the emphasize on the immersive experience of the neighborhood photos. We are not actually selling any property, so we don't feature glam professionally staged shots of a neighborhood; We show authentic photos taken nearby, provided by Google Maps Places API.

Phase 2 of production will include adding a more complete list of neighborhoods to the homepage, as well as arranging them in an interactive vector map of Toronto.
