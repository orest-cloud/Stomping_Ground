# Stomping Ground
## A React app that brings together property listings data, neighborhood walkability scores, and Google Maps user photos.

**Browse property listings and get a look inside neighborhoods you're interested in.**

In a time when global and even local travel has been shut down, people still want to get a sense of the neighbourhood they're considering moving to. Walkability to nearby amenities and access to transit is an important factor in choosing a home.

What differentiates _Stomping Ground_ from existing websites is the emphasis on the immersive experience of the neighborhood photos. We are not actually selling any property, so we don't feature glam professionally staged shots of a neighborhood; We show authentic photos taken nearby, provided by Google Maps Places API.
